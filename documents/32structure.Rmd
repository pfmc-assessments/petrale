## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment (not required for an update assessment)

The last update assessment of Petrale sole was conducted in 2019. The 2019 assessment model was the starting point for this assessment, and a bridging analysis was done to investigate the impact of increment changes to the assessment model. For this assessment, we retained a number of features of the 2019 assessment and also included a number of improvements related to use of data and modeling techniques.  Below, we describe the most important changes made since the last full assessment and provide rationale for each change:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Upgraded to Stock Synthesis version 3.30.21 (released in February 2023). 
Rationale:  This is standard practice to capitalize on newly developed features and corrections to older versions as well as improvements in computational efficiency.  Model results were nearly identical before and after this change. 

\item Removing fishery CPUE time series. 
Rationale: 

\item Combining Winter and Summer fleets into corresponding annual North and South fleets. 
Rationale: The separation of North and South fleets into the Winter and Summer fleets were primarily motivated by the using the fishery CPUE indices (form Winter fisheries). With removal of CPUE indices from the model, separation into Winter and Summer fleets was no longer needed. Selectivity curves estimated for Winter and Summer fleets in both North and South were very similar, and our initial exploration of mirroring selectivity of Winter and Summer fleets yielded identical results. Combining Winter and Summer fleets within North and South fleets removed uncertainty associated with separating annual catches by season (Winter fleet was defined as November of previous year through the February of the current year), since only limited records of landings by month is available in the pre-PacFIN period. Finally, using annual catches (and not assigning to current year catches from previous) puts assessment in alignment with management system, which operated on a calendar year basis.  

\item Using a single triennial survey time series (instead separating it into early and late indices).
Rationale: The triennial index was separated in the past assessment dues to change in depth and latitudinal coverage of the triennial survey. Treating the survey as a single index did not make a difference, but provided for a longer historical single series, but simplified the structure of the assessment model.

\item Updating input sample sizes using a combination of number of trips and number and fish (rather than using number of trips, as sample sizes).
Rationale: According to best practices.

\item Updating maturity and fecundity parameters.
Rationale: To incorporate the most up-to-date information.
