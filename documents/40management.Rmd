## Reference Points
Estimated reference points are reported in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}.

## Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties (Not required in draft assessment undergoing review)

## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables (Not required in draft assessment undergoing review)

## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty
The model estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning output for is $\sigma$ = `r round(mod_base$Pstar_sigma, 2)`. The uncertainty around the OFL is $\sigma$ = `r round(mod_base$OFL_sigma, 2)`. These values are lower than for many west coast groundfish stocks for several reasons: large sample sizes of length and age data from fisheries and surveys, high frequency of occurrence in the \Gls{s-wcgbt} thanks to petrale primarily residing in trawlable habitat within the scope of the survey, and strong contrast in the data caused by fishing down the stock to a low level followed by rapid rebuilding. Nevertheless, these $\sigma$ values surely underestimate the overall uncertainty as they do not incorporate the model structural uncertainty and do not account for any time-varying dynamics other than recruitment.

The estimated uncertainty values are lower than the Category 1 default $\sigma = 0.5$, so all projections will use the default $\sigma$.

## Research and Data Needs

Progress on a number of research topics and data issues would substantially improve the ability of this assessment to reliably and precisely model `r spp` population dynamics in the future:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Continue research toward better understanding how climate forcing impacts density-independent survival during `r spp` early life stages and further development of environmental recruitment index. Such index can provide additional information on recruitment, not captured by other sources, in most recent years when youngest cohorts may be not yet selected by either surveys or fisheries. 

\item The extent of spatial and temporal variability on productivity processes such as growth, recruitment, and maturity is currently unknown and would benefit from further research. It would allow to better understanding of patterns we see in data and account for potential spatio-temporal variability in life history parameters in the model. 

\item Further studies of transboundary movement of `r spp` between U.S. and Canadian waters would be beneficial for understanding of extend of `r spp` to help lay the groundwork for future collaborative effort between U.S. and Canada and potential transboundary assessment.

\item The analytical solution for catchability (i.e., observed / predicted biomass) for the \Gls{s-wcgbt} is above 1.0 in the base model.  This was also the case in previous assessments of `r spp` and other flatfish assessments.  Further research into flatfish behaviors in response to survey gear will enhance the interpretation of catchability values for `r spp` off the West Coast.
