### Sensitivity Analyses
We performed a number of sensitivity analyses on the base assessment model, to evaluate the base model’s response to change in key parameters and model components.The sensitivity analyses were divided into six groups: indices, composition data, biology, recruitment and environmental index, and the transboundary nature of the stock  (Tables \ref{tab:sens-table-index} to \ref{tab:sens-table-Canada} and Figures \ref{fig:sens-index1} to \ref{fig:sens-Canada1}).
<!-- TODO: revise table and figure ranges after adding additional senstivity tables and figures -->

These groups included the following runs:

Indices

\begin{enumerate}

\item Estimating separate catchability parameter and separate selectivity parameters for the late \gls{s-tri} period.

\item Excluding \gls{s-tri} 2004 observation.

\item Allowing \gls{s-tri} selectivity to be dome-shaped.

\item Estimating extra standard deviation for the \Gls{s-wcgbt}

\item Including fisheries CPUEs in the model.

\end{enumerate}

Composition data

\begin{enumerate}

\item Tuning the sample sizes using the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood.

\item Early surface read ages are included and retuned.

\end{enumerate}

Biology

\begin{enumerate}

\item Weight-Length relationship from 2019 assessment.

\item Maturity parameters from 2019 assessment.

\item Estimating age-0 fraction female within the model.

\item Estimating age-0 fraction female with no sex offset on the \Gls{s-wcgbt}on selectivity parameters.

\end{enumerate}

Recruitment

\begin{enumerate}

\item Incorporating environmental index of `r spp` recruitment based on CMEMS.

\end{enumerate}

Transboundary nature of the stock

\begin{enumerate}

\item Adding the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) synoptic bottom trawl survey index to the assessment model.

\item Adding `r spp` catches from British Columbia waters to the North fishing fleet.

\item Adding both index and catches to the base model.

\end{enumerate}

### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by successively removing years of data starting from 2022 (i.e., “Data -1 Years” corresponds to data through 2021 instead of 2022). The estimated spawning output exhibited small changes in the initial equilibrium and the final few years of the model (Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}). These changes are driven primarily by the fit to the \Gls{s-wcgbt}, where the combination of the lower observed index in 2018 and 2019 and the absence of a survey in 2020 resulted in the Data-2 through Data-4 retrospectives to a more steeply declining trend at the end of the time series (Figure \ref{fig:retro-index}). Estimates of the fraction of unfished spawning output showed very little change across retrospectives (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}).

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and female natural mortality values separately (Figures \ref{fig:r0-profile} - \ref{fig:m-profile-pars}). These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimating the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value. The priors for all parameters, including the parameter being profiled, were included in every likelihood model. For example, including the prior on natural mortality across the profiled values of natural mortality provides information on the likelihood contribution of that prior as if it were estimated in the model.
