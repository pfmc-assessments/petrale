## Fishery-Dependent Data
Fishery removals in this assessment were divided among two fleets: 1) North and 2) South. Landings for the North fleet are defined as fish landed in Washington and Oregon ports. Landings for the South feet are defined as fish landed in California ports. The landings of Petrale sole are made primarily by groundfish bottom trawl gear; landings by gear types other than bottom trawl have been inconsequential, averaging less than 2.5% of the coast-wide landings. The non-trawl landings (that consist of only a small fraction of the total landings) are included along with the trawl landings in a single gears fleets.

### Commercial Fishery Landings

All landings for this assessment were summarized by state based on port of landing. Landings for Washington and Oregon are summed into a single North fleet (consistent with previous several assessments) due to the fact that vessels commonly fish and land in each other's waters and ports.

#### Recent Landings

Recent commercial landings of `r spp` (1981-2022 for California and Washington; 1987-2022 for Oregon) were obtained from the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN, www.pacfin.com), a regional fisheries database that manages fishery-dependent information in cooperation with west coast state agencies and NOAA Fisheries. Catch data were extracted from PacFIN on June 12, 2023, by state and then combined into the fishing fleets used in the assessment. Time series of recent landings by fleet and state are reported in Table \ref{tab:catch-table} and shown in Figures \ref{fig:catch-figures-r4ss} to \ref{fig:catch-comparison}.

#### Historical Landings

Historical landings of `r spp` were reconstructed by state, by year. 

The Washington historical landings (1938 -1980) were provided by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, who recently conducted historical catch reconstruction for `r spp` (pers. comm. T. Tsou and G. Lippert, WDFW). A linear interpolation was applied between landings in 1938 and zero landings in 1930.

The  Oregon historical landings (1896-1986) were obtained from Oregon historical catch reconstruction, conducted by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in collaboration with NWFSC [@karnowski_historical_2014]. 

The California historical landings were informed by several sources. The most recent “historical” period (between 1969 and 1980) were available from the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CalCOM) database. Earlier landing records (between 1931 and 1968) were reconstructed by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center  [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Ralston et al. (2010) included only California landings made in California ports, therefore Ralston et al. (2010) estimates were supplemented by catches landed in California ports, but made in waters of Oregon and Washington, provided by the SWFSC (pers. comm. E.J. Dick, SWFSC). The earliest California landings were obtained from California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) Fish Bulletins for 1916-1930 landings [@heimann_pacific_1970] as reconstructed by Lai et al. [-@lai_stock_2005] and used in previous assessments. The California fishery began in 1876, but no landings data are available from 1876-1915. Therefore, consistent with previous `r spp` assessments, a linear interpolation between landings of 1 ton in 1876 and the landings recorded for 1916 are used to filling this period.

Comparison between `r spp` historical landings by state and fleet is provided in Figure \ref{fig:catch-comparison}. Historical Oregon and California landings did not change. Slight discrepancies in landings between 2019 and 2023 in California landings in Figure \ref{fig:catch-comparison} is caused by the fact that fishing year in 2019 model was defined from November of previous year to October of current year, since North and South fleets were further divided into Winter and Summer fisheries. We did not have access to original annual landings used in 2013 full assessment, and therefore comparison between 2019 and 2023 in Figure \ref{fig:catch-comparison} is approximate, but it still able to illustrate that California landings did not change. The noticeable difference in this assessment from 2019 model is in Washington landings. This year Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife completed historical catch reconstruction of `r spp`, and newly estimated landings are lower than those used in previous assessment. We were not able to locate the source of historical Washington landings used in 2013 and subsequently  2019 assessments, but newly estimated Washington landings are more consistent with history of commercial removals on the West Coast and represent improvement to the assessment.  

### Discard

Data on discards of `r spp` are available from two different data sources. In 2002, the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) was implemented on the West Coast of the United States, which began with gathering bycatch and discard information for the limited entry trawl and fixed gear fleets. Observer coverage has expanded to include the California halibut trawl, the nearshore fixed gear and pink shrimp trawl fisheries. 

Since 2011, trawl fisheries have been managed with catch shares under a system of annual individual fishing quotas (IFQs) for the shoreside sector (i.e., vessels delivering to shoreside processors) and harvest cooperatives for the at-sea hake sectors (catcher-processors who catch and process hake at sea; and Motherships, factory processors that take delivery of hake from catcher vessels at sea). A 100 percent at-sea monitoring of catch using observers and electronic monitoring (EM) is required to participate in the trawl catch share fishery.

Table \ref{tab:Discard} shows the discard ratios (discarded/(discarded + retained)) of `r spp` from WCGOP based on observer observations. The discarding rate of `r spp` within this data-set has always been relatively low.  Discard rates were obtained for both the catch share and the non-catch share sector for `r spp`. 
Vast majority of removals was made within the catch share fleet, and therefore, discard rates from the catch share sector was used for the perios after 2011. Coefficient of variations were calculated for the pre-catch share years by bootstrapping vessels within ports because the observer program randomly chooses vessels within ports to be observed. The coefficient of variation of discarding in the catch share fleet, given nearly 100% observer coverage, was considered low and a value of 0.015 was assumed. The discard rates from WCGOP are shown in Table \ref{tab:Discard}. 

The historical source (often referred to as the Pikitch data) comes from a study organized by Ellen Pikitch that collected trawl discards from 1985-1987 [@pikitch_evaluation_1988]. The northern and southern boundaries of the study were 48\textdegree 42\textquotesingle N latitude and 42\textdegree 60\textquotesingle N latitude respectively, which is primarily within the Columbia INPFC area (Pikitch et al. 1988, Rogers and Pikitch 1992). Therefore, this source of discard data is only relevant to North fleet. Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears. Observers of normal fishing operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow, and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample. The discard ratios (discarded/(discarded + retained)) from the Pikitch data were obtained from NWFSC (pers. comm. J. Wallace, NWFSC), and are also shown in Table \ref{tab:Discard}

### Fishery Length and Age Data

The fishery length and age data for North fleet were obtained from PacFIN BDS database and contained data from Oregon and Washington. For South fleet, length and age data were obtained from PacFIN BDS database and from the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CalCOM), the latter were provided by CDFG (pers.comm. B. Erwin, CDFG). 

Length bins from 12 to 62 cm in 2 cm increments were used to summarize the length frequency of the survey catches in each year. The first length bin includes all observations less than 14 cm and the last bin includes all fish larger than 62 cm. Age distributions included bins from age 1 to age 17, with the last bin including all fish of greater age.

Commercial length-frequency distributions were developed for each year and state for which observations were available. For each fleet, the raw observations (compiled from the PacFIN and CalCOM databases) were expanded to the trip level, to account for the relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained. The expanded length observations were then expanded by the landings in each state for the combined Washington and Oregon fleet. Age frequencies were computed in the same manner, except that age observations for Washington and Oregon were not combined due to ageing error considerations. The length and age composition expansion was conducted using the PacFIN.Utilities (Johnson and Wetzel 2023) package in R publicly available via GitHUB.

In previous assessments, it was identified that some of the Oregon `r spp` samples collected prior to 1987 represent samples were collected for special projects (pers. comm. A. Whitman, ODFW). For this assessment, Oregon length and age samples were thorough evaluated and non-standard Oregon historical samples were filtered out and not used to generate length and age compositions.
 
Also, some of the early historical `r spp` ages were estimated using surface ageing method, and concerns over the reliability of those early surface age estimates (including consistent underestimation of ages using surface methods) and their potential impacts on estimated selectivity and growth, were raised in multiple previous `r spp` assessments. In this assessment, early surface read ages were not used to generate age compositions of `r spp`. The impact of excluding early surface read ages on assessment model results was explored through sensitivity analysis.

Length and age data collected from commercial landings for each fleet are summarized by the number of trips and fish sampled by year (Tables \ref{tab:sample-size-length-by-fleet} and XX). Figures \ref{fig:len-all-bubbles} and \ref{fig:age-all-bubbles} show plots of the commercial length and age composition data across time for each fishery fleet.

The input sample sizes for length and age frequency distributions by year were calculated as a function of the number of trips and number of fish via the Stewart Method (pers.comm. I. Stewart, International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC)). The method is based on analysis of the input and model derived effective sample sizes from west coast groundfish stock assessments. A piece-wise linear regression was used to estimate the increase in effective sample size per sample based on fish-per-sample and the maximum effective sample size for large numbers of individual fish.

Discard length composition data for both fleets were available from WCGOP, and for North fleet from Pikitch study as well. WCGOP length composition data were not sex-specific. WCGOP raw observations were expanded the haul level, to account for differences in catch among hauls. Pikitch data (although available by sex) were very limited (32 fish sampled for length), and was included in the assessment for females and males combined. No age data were available for discarded fish.

### Discard Mean Body Weight

WCGOP provided estimates of discard mean body weight, and these data were used in this assessment for each fishing fleets. The mean body weight of discarded fish are shown in Figures \ref{fig:mnwt_fitNorth} and \ref{fig:mnwt_fitSouth}.
